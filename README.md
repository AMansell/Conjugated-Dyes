A simulation of uv-vis absorption spectra of a handful of cyanine dyes

This program is designed to complement a common experiment in undergraduate physical chemistry teaching laboratories in which students apply the particle-in-a-box model (PIB) to predict the HOMO-LUMO transition energy of cyanine dyes with different polymethine chain lengths.

As a brief overview, the Ï€-electrons in the polymethine chain occupy the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and are therefore responsible for the color of the dye. These electrons experience little potential energy within the chain, but are restricted (at to an extent) from entering the end groups. This system can be modeled using the PIB
